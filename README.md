# ProsperLoan-Analysis
The final project of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Prosper Loan Data Analysis Project
### 📊 Project Overview
This project was completed as the final project of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. It explores the Prosper Loan Dataset, which contains rich information about peer-to-peer lending and borrower behavior. The analysis is divided into two parts: an initial exploratory analysis and a more focused explanatory data visualization component.

### 🔍 Goals
Understand key relationships between borrower attributes and loan outcomes

Identify patterns related to interest rates, loan status, and Prosper ratings

Use visualizations to communicate insights clearly

### 📌 Dataset
Name: Prosper Loan Data

Records: ~113,000 loans

Features: 81 variables (e.g. borrower income, credit score, loan term, loan status)

Source: Udacity-hosted Prosper dataset

### 💡 Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

### 📊 Summary of Findings
Interest rates are most influenced by Prosper rating, borrower creditworthiness, and loan term.

Loans with longer terms and lower Prosper ratings generally have higher interest rates.

Certain employment statuses and income levels show clear trends in loan performance.

The final visual was crafted to illustrate the strong relationship between Prosper Rating and Interest Rate, offering a clear takeaway for lenders and borrowers alike.
